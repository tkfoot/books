## Project Structure

This repository is set up for novel writing with the following structure:
- `manuscript/` - Main novel chapters and sections
- `characters/` - Character profiles and development notes
- `world/` - World-building documents and settings
- `plot/` - Plot outlines, story arcs, and planning documents
- `research/` - Background research and reference materials
- `drafts/` - Previous versions and alternative scenes

## Writing Workflow

When working on the novel:
1. Create new chapters in `manuscript/` with consistent naming (e.g., `chapter-01.md`)
2. Maintain character consistency by referencing profiles in `characters/`
3. Keep world-building details in `world/` for continuity
4. Update plot documents when making story changes
5. Use drafts folder for alternative versions or deleted scenes

## File Organization

- Use Markdown format for all writing files
- Include chapter numbers and titles in filenames
- Create separate files for major characters, locations, and plot threads
- Maintain a master timeline document for chronological consistency

## Novel Development

Focus on:
- Character development and consistency
- Plot progression and pacing
- World-building coherence
- Dialogue authenticity
- Scene transitions and structure
